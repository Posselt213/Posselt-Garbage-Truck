    "In this program, we \"ask\" to 3 students their ages so we can make a sample mean example using variable, int, input, and sample mean in unarranged values.\n",
    " First, we ask the students age and we save it in 3 different variables.\n",
    "Then we add and divide those 3 ages in the next form (age1+ 2 + 3) all this divided by the number of students, in this case, is 3, and all this we save it in a variable named Sample.\n",
    "In the end, we print what we want to show that was the result of the sample mean so we write \"the sample mean is {Sample}\"\n",
